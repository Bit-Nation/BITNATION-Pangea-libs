## Overview

The Pangea librarys are a collection of modules / tool's consumed by the pangea mobile and desktop client. It's written in JavaScript backed by [flow](https://flow.org/).

## Tech stack
- [Realm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/realm) is used as the database (can be used on node js & react native)
- [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for testing
- [Flow](https://flow.org/) as a static type checker for JS (it's opt in via `//@flow` at the top of your file and has almost the same syntax as typescript)
