# Web3 & Pangea

Web3 is a js library that is used to interact with the ethereum nodes. Pangea uses an custom Web3 provider build with the [web3 provider engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web3-provider-engine). The reason is, that we need a custom way to sign transactions. With an standart web3 provider, you used the accounts of the ethereum node (saved in the files system where the node is running) that of course makes no sense for remote nodes since they are run by people you don't know and you don't have access to there fs + you don't want to put your private key on a strangers machine. Our provider fetch the account's from the secure storage and signing and transaction is customized so that we need to ask the user for his permission to sign a transaction (have a look at the `signTx` method in `ethereum/utils.js`). Depending on the internet connectivity we produce different web3 instances (have a look at `ethereum/web3.js` for details).
